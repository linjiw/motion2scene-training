"""Sample and freeze evaluation scenes before anything is tuned against them.

Every counterfactual family built so far is *fitted*: the obstacle is placed where a
particular executed trajectory's swept volume separates from another's. That makes those
scenes training material and nothing else. Evaluating on them answers a question nobody
asked -- whether a model can recover geometry the generator derived from the very
trajectories it was trained on.

So the test scenes are sampled independently of any motion, and frozen now, while there is
still nothing to tune them against. Later is too late: once an adaptation operator and a
selector exist, any resampling of these parameters is indistinguishable from choosing the
ones that flatter them, including to the person doing it.

**What freezing does and does not permit.** Running any number of candidate motions through
these scenes to obtain physics labels is fine and expected -- that is how the ground truth is
made. Moving an obstacle, changing a height, or dropping a scene because a result came out
badly is not. The manifest carries a SHA-256 over the parameters so a later run can prove the
geometry is unchanged.

Parameters are drawn from ranges that bracket what the corpus can execute, deliberately
including values where *no* behaviour succeeds and values where *every* behaviour does. A
test set holding only discriminative scenes would measure something easier than the real
task, in which most geometry is uninformative and the model has to notice which is not.
