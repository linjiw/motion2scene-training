"""Write a scene whose difficulty was chosen, and verify it before a rollout is spent.

Takes a configuration from ``plan_graded_families`` -- a binding body part, the obstacle type that
binds it, and a margin -- and places the solid so the executed body clears it by exactly that
margin. A ceiling spans the corridor at a chosen height; a wall stands beside the route at a chosen
lateral offset, occupying the band that selects the part it binds.

Nothing here is searched. The placement follows from the reach the criticality map measured, and the
result is checked against the executed capsules before it is written, because a scene the robot
never meets costs a rollout to discover and teaches nothing.
