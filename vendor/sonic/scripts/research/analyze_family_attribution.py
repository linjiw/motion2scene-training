"""Ask *why* each cell of a counterfactual family passed or failed.

A 2x2 whose bottom-left cell is merely ``rejected`` proves nothing. The claim is that a
named obstacle stopped a named body at a predicted moment, and a rejection that happens to
arrive by some other route -- the robot drifted into a wall, fell over, tangled its own
legs -- would support the same table while meaning something entirely different. That
happened once already: an adapted motion failed both scenes at an identical 710.9 N, which
looked like a shelf result until the contact turned out to be legs against a far wall.

So this measures **failure attribution purity**:

* is the first disqualifying event the intended obstacle contact, or something earlier?
* is the contacting body in the group the regime targets (overhead -> head/torso)?
* does the observed contact frame agree with the one geometry predicted from the probe?
* did the reference drift begin before the contact, or is it the contact's consequence?

The last question matters because ``nominal_hard`` is rejected for both
``disallowed_robot_contact`` and ``unstable_reference_drift``. If the drift came first, the
episode failed for tracking reasons and the shelf is incidental. If it followed the contact,
it *is* the collision's downstream effect and the attribution is clean.
