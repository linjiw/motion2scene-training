"""Score banded 2x2 families: does each one show the counterfactual, and if not, why not?

A family holds when the same journey survives an easy scene under both motions, and a hard scene
only under the adapted one. Four cells, one pattern:

    nominal_easy  accepted     adapted_easy  accepted
    nominal_hard  REJECTED     adapted_hard  accepted

Reporting that as a single Boolean throws away the interesting part. A family can miss in ways that
mean opposite things: the hard scene failing to stop the nominal is a placement problem, while an
adapted cell failing on tracking is the adaptation costing more than the controller will spend --
and only the second is a statement about the method. So each family is scored into a named miss
mode, and the endpoint error is carried alongside because it is the quantity P6 predicts.
