"""Build and verify one counterfactual family end to end, in physics.

The geometric prediction is cheap: binary-search a shelf against the executed swept volume
and read off the height at which one motion interferes and another does not. That prediction
is not a result. This runs the 2x2 that turns it into one.

Protocol, six rollouts:

1. **probe** -- run the nominal and adapted motions on a bare plane, to obtain the executed
   swept volume each one actually produces. The scene cannot be built from a reference,
   because the question is whether *this trajectory* collides.
2. **boundary** -- binary-search the shelf height at which the nominal motion's swept volume
   first interferes.
3. **verify** -- build an easy and a hard scene around that boundary and roll *both* motions
   through *both*, giving the 2x2 the claim rests on:

   ================  =============  =============
   scene             nominal        adapted
   ================  =============  =============
   easy              expect pass    expect pass
   hard              **expect fail**  **expect pass**
   ================  =============  =============

The bottom row is the family. If the hard scene stops the nominal motion and not the
adapted one, geometry decided the behaviour, and the pair is supervision no
scene-around-motion episode can provide.
