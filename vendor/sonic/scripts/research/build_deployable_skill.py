"""Retime the adapted clips that cleared their obstacle and were rejected for arriving short.

The 2026-08-19 banded batch produced the counterfactual it was designed for and could not bank it.
`n_013_ceiling_overhead_left` walks its nominal torso into the ceiling at 1543.6 N and clears the
same ceiling adapted at 49 N -- and *both* adapted cells were rejected, for
`reference_endpoint_tracking_error` rather than for contact. The cause is in the operator: a local
crouch lowers the root and leaves the forward schedule alone, so the reference asks a crouched G1
to walk at an upright pace and it arrives 0.52 m short of a 0.35 m budget. Since a ceiling can only
be relieved by lowering the robot, that bounds the whole overhead band structurally.

This script does not touch the causal reference and does not move the gate. It writes a *second*
artifact from the same pair -- the deployable skill -- by retiming the adapted clip so the stretch
where the adaptation is active is commanded at the pace the robot was measured to deliver. Route,
start, goal, joint angles at each route position and the obstacle's station in route progress are
all held; duration is not, which is exactly the thing a matched counterfactual must hold and a
deployable skill must not.

The pace comes from the family's own rollout: the adapted cell's endpoint error minus the
nominal's, divided by the arclength the adaptation was active over. Nothing is inferred from the
clip -- four attempts to predict trackability from a clip rather than measure it are recorded as
wrong in docs/prediction_register.md.

Selection is deliberately narrow. A family is retimed only when its adapted cell failed on
*tracking alone*; one that also struck the obstacle has an operator problem, not a transport
problem, and slowing it down would hide that behind a longer clip.
