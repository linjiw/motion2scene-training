"""Place a ladder of shelf heights across a family's predicted window.

The swept-volume search predicts each motion's own clearance boundary, and a family is built by
putting one shelf between them. That is a *centre* placement -- maximally robust, and silent
about where the real transitions are. If the prediction is off by 40 mm, the family still works
and nobody finds out.

This writes scenes at several heights spanning the window so the predicted boundaries can be
compared against the observed ones. Against the family's own scene each rung differs only in the
shelf's height and its scene id, with one exception worth recording: the room's walls move by
0.2 mm, because the floor's width is stored to three decimals and re-deriving wall positions from
it rounds. The walls stand 5.37 m from a shelf interaction at x = 2.23 m, so this cannot reach
the result, but a reader comparing the files should not have to wonder.

It also repairs the family manifest, which recorded the two shelf heights but neither the
executed root path nor the room size, so the scenes it described could not be rebuilt from it.
