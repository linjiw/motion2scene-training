"""Re-run a counterfactual family's 2x2 under small initial-state perturbations.

The family is discovered from an executed trajectory and verified by replaying that same
motion into a scene built around it. SONIC rollouts are highly deterministic under a fixed
configuration, which is exactly what makes scene-around-motion generation work -- and it is
also the obvious objection to the result: *you placed an obstacle on a trajectory you had
already recorded, then replayed that trajectory.*

Discovery and verification therefore must not share a single deterministic capture. This
runs the four cells again from perturbed initial states -- the robot placed a centimetre or
two off, turned a fraction of a degree -- and asks whether the same 2x2 comes back. A result
that survives is robust to placement; a result that does not was an artifact of one replay,
and it is far better to learn that here than from a reviewer.

The three claim levels this separates:

* **geometrically predicted** -- the swept volumes say a window exists
* **nominally physics verified** -- the unperturbed 2x2 came out as predicted
* **start-pose outcome-robust** -- and it still does when the start pose is jittered

The third level is narrower than the word "robust" suggests, and the difference matters. What
is established is that the *outcome* survives a start-pose jitter. Severity does not: peak
contact force on the failing cell ranged 95.5 to 658.3 N across three jitters against 137.2 N
unperturbed. Whether the torso meets the shelf is stable; how hard it meets it is not. This
also says nothing about robustness to dynamics, mass, friction or actuation noise, none of
which are varied here.
