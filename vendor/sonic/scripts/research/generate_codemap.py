"""Generate the code map from the modules themselves, so it cannot drift.

A hand-written index of 154 files is stale the week it is written. This reads each file's first
docstring line and files it under a pipeline stage, so the map is regenerated rather than
maintained. Anything that does not match a stage is listed as unclassified rather than dropped --
a map that silently omits files is worse than no map.
