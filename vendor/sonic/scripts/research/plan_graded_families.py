"""Plan a family from a chosen binding part and margin, instead of searching for one.

Families have been built one at a time: place a shelf, roll out, lower it, roll out again. That
costs several rollouts per family and produces scenes whose difficulty nobody chose. The
criticality map replaces the search: for a given height band and approach direction it says which
body part an obstacle meets and how far that part reaches, so the obstacle's position follows from
a margin picked in advance.

This plans -- it does not roll out. It emits, per configuration, the operator that relieves the
binding part, the adapted clip, both obstacle positions, and a route check confirming the robot
actually passes through the obstacle's footprint. Everything that can be wrong before a GPU is
touched is checked here, because the expensive half is the rollout.
