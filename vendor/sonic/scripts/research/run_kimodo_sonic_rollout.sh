# Run one SONIC physics rollout of a converted Kimodo G1 reference in a repo-owned scene.
#
# The M0 spike proved this path with ad-hoc commands whose artifacts were ephemeral. This
# script exists so a rollout is reproducible and its outputs land in a named directory.
#
# Isaac/Hydra can print a fatal traceback and still exit zero (eval_agent_trl.py ends in
# os._exit(0)), so success here is defined by the explicit SONIC_EVAL_SUCCESS marker AND the
# expected artifacts, never by process status.

Usage:
  scripts/research/run_kimodo_sonic_rollout.sh \
    --scene household_room|factory_aisle \
    --motion /abs/path/motion.pkl \
    --out /abs/path/output_dir \
    [--checkpoint /abs/path/last.pt] \
    [--python /abs/path/python] \
    [--scene-package /abs/path/scene_package] \
    [--scene-usd /abs/path/exact_scene.usda] \
    [--resolve-only] \
    [--max-steps auto|<int>] \
    [--trajectory-only] \
    [--task "natural language instruction"]

Writes <out>/trajectories, <out>/rollout.log, and—unless `--trajectory-only` is
set—<out>/renders. Requires the SONIC_EVAL_SUCCESS marker before reporting success.
--scene-usd binds the file independently of the logical --scene ID.
--resolve-only prints NUL-separated scene ID and resolved USD path, then exits
before creating output directories or invoking Python/Isaac.

# PYTHONPATH is REPLACED (not extended) with this repository, for two reasons:
#   1. The shell profile puts ROS's Python 3.10 site-packages on PYTHONPATH, which
#      shadows pinocchio inside this 3.11 environment.
#   2. The `gear_sonic` editable install in env_isaaclab resolves to a DIFFERENT
#      checkout (groot-wbc-sonic-sim-trackb), and its static editable finder does not
#      know about subpackages added after install (e.g. dataset_generation). The
#      script's own `sys.path.append(os.getcwd())` appends too late to win. Without
#      this line the rollout silently runs another checkout's code.
# motion.debug_vis defaults to TRUE, which draws the reference-motion goal markers
# (yellow spheres, diffuse_color=(1,1,0)) as real scene prims. The ego TiledCamera
# renders them, so the recorded observation contains the tracking target itself --
# a train/deploy visual mismatch AND goal leakage that lets a VLA follow the markers
# instead of grounding language and scene. Recording a dataset requires it off.
#
# The release checkpoint ships three encoders (g1/teleop/smpl) and samples between them.
# A Kimodo G1-qpos reference must be tracked by the g1 encoder, so +use_encoder=g1 below
# pins it. Leaving it unpinned silently leaves encoder choice to sampling, and the export
# binding gate rejects the result.
