"""Search the corpus for motion pairs that could form a counterfactual family.

Every family so far was built from a hand-picked pair, which does not scale and wastes what
already exists: 131 distinct executed trajectories are recorded, and the pair that separates
under some obstacle is probably among them. Asking the generator for a new adapted motion
each time is both slower and worse, because a generated motion still has to be rolled out
before anything is known about it, while these have been.

Two stages, cheap then expensive:

1. **signature** -- reduce each trajectory to the numbers pairing needs, and reject pairs
   that are not doing the same task. This is where most candidates die, and it should be:
   two motions that end up in different places are not a counterfactual whatever their
   swept volumes do.
2. **station** -- for surviving overhead pairs, scan the shared route for the position where
   the window is widest. This is what the family builder then uses, and it is far more
   honest than the global minimum: on the one measured family the global spread reads
   0.197 m where the station-aware value reads 0.052 m against a measured 0.053 m.
