"""Split a capture that spans an environment reset into independent passes.

A recorder captures a fixed number of frames. If the environment terminates early it
resets and starts the reference again, and the capture keeps going -- so one file can hold
the tail of one pass and the head of the next, stitched at a discontinuity. Every
downstream quantity computed over such a file is meaningless: path length sums a teleport,
endpoint error compares the wrong endpoints, contact peaks may belong to a different pass.

The acceptance evaluator already refuses these, with the message "motion_time_s is not
monotonic and must be split at reset boundaries". This module is the split it asks for.

Two reasons this is worth doing rather than discarding the file:

* **A reset-spanning capture usually contains one good pass.** Discarding it throws away a
  complete episode because a second, partial one was appended.
* **"Unevaluable" and "rejected" are different facts.** A capture that could not be
  evaluated says nothing about the motion; a rejected one says the motion failed. Counting
  the first as the second inflates the rejection rate and hides the recording bug behind
  what looks like a controller problem.

Splitting is done on ``motion_time_s``, which is the reference clock: it advances with the
motion and restarts at a reset. A drop in that series is the boundary, and it is exact --
no threshold or heuristic is involved.
