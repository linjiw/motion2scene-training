"""An LfLH-style learned hallucinator for the humanoid overhead case, and its honest baseline.

LfLH learns `q_psi(C | p)` by pushing sampled obstacles through a **fixed differentiable planner**
and reconstructing the trajectory. That design is what gives hallucinated obstacles their
semantics: obstacle parameters can only move the decoder's output by actually changing planning
cost, so encoder and decoder cannot collude.

Our real decoder -- a frozen SONIC policy in Isaac -- is neither differentiable, cheap, nor
deterministic, so the LfLH training loop cannot be run against it. This module runs the loop
against a **differentiable surrogate** of the one decision the real decoder makes, in order to
answer a methodological question rather than to ship a hallucinator:

    Given the same trajectories, does a learned Gaussian hallucinator recover the set of obstacle
    placements that explain a humanoid counterfactual, or does it collapse onto one of them?

The comparison is unusually clean here because, unlike in the 2-D mobile-robot case, **the exact
answer is known**. For the overhead axis the set of face coordinates that make the nominal strike
and the adaptation clear is the closed-form interval `[R_adapted + delta, R_nominal - delta]` at
each station. So we can measure coverage against ground truth instead of guessing at it.

Nothing here proposes a scene for physics. The surrogate is a study instrument.

**RETRACTION NOTICE (2026-08-26).** The first result produced with this module is withdrawn; see
`docs/hallucination/REPORT_LFLH_COMPARISON.md`. Three defects made it an artifact and are now
documented in place rather than quietly fixed, so the retraction stays reproducible:

* `Hallucinator.min_log_sigma` clamps the variance, and the retracted headline was exactly the
  clamp floor. `clamp` has no gradient outside its range, so the parameter was dead.
* `train` optimises a convex reconstruction loss with **no entropy or KL term**, so `sigma -> 0`
  is a theorem of the objective, not an experimental finding. Pass `kl_weight` to add the term.
* The coordinate is anchored on `adapted.mean()`, which is the feasible window's lower edge, so a
  perfect `valid_rate` is the parameterisation talking rather than the model.

This module must not be cited as evidence about learned hallucinators until those are addressed.
