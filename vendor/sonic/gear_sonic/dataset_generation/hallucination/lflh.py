"""Multi-obstacle LfLH for humanoid whole-body counterfactuals.

The first attempt at this (``learned_hallucinator.py``, retracted) reduced the problem to two
parameters and a decoder that was a soft indicator of a closed-form interval. A review showed the
result was an artifact: the model was a constant function of its input, its variance sat on a
clamp, and the decoder encoded the answer it was supposed to recover.

This is the real thing, built to the structure LfLH actually uses:

    trajectory  ->  hallucinator  ->  K obstacles  ->  fixed differentiable decoder  ->  choice
                                                                                          |
                                    reconstruction loss <---------------------------------+

with three properties the retracted version lacked.

**The decoder decides something.** It does not evaluate a known interval. Given obstacles it scores
*every* candidate motion — the nominal, crouches at several depths, one-sided arm tucks — for
feasibility, and returns a soft-argmin over edit cost among the survivors. Reconstruction asks the
observed motion to come out as the winner. Obstacles can only change that by actually blocking some
candidates and not others, which is the property that stops encoder and decoder colluding.

**The inverse set is genuinely multimodal.** An overhead bar explains a crouch; a left-side
obstacle explains a left arm tuck; a right-side obstacle explains a right one; and several
obstacle sets explain the same observation. There is no closed form to leak, so coverage of the
inverse set is a real question rather than a tautology.

**The losses are LfLH's**, including the two the retracted version omitted: a genuine Gaussian KL
on obstacle size (which carries ``-log sigma`` and therefore opposes contraction) and an
obstacle-obstacle repulsion. Without them collapse is a theorem, not a finding.

Nothing here is a physics verdict. The decoder is a differentiable model of the *choice* rule; the
frozen controller in Isaac remains the only thing that decides whether a motion actually executes.

    ``anneal_from_m`` starts the decoder soft and sharpens it to its configured temperature over
    training. A sharp decoder is the faithful one, but its gradient is flat wherever a candidate is
    comfortably blocked or comfortably clear, which is everywhere outside a band a few centimetres
    wide. Annealing gives the optimiser a signal to follow in before the decision is made crisp.
    LfLH anneals its own loss weights over 1000 epochs for the same reason.

    ``seed_latents`` starts the output head at a computed placement; see `closed_form_seed`.
