"""Bend one nominal motion locally, instead of pairing two independently generated ones.

Every family so far pairs two separately generated clips: a walk and a crouch that were never
the same motion. A reviewer can reasonably ask whether the shelf separated the *behaviours* or
merely two different journeys that happened to be labelled differently, and the honest answer
is that the construction cannot tell them apart.

This operator removes the question. It starts from a nominal motion that has already been
tracked and accepted, and changes only the degrees of freedom needed to clear one obstacle,
over only the stretch of route where that obstacle is. Everything else is held:

* root XY and yaw, so both motions walk the same line
* duration and frame count, so gait phase stays aligned
* start and goal
* waist pitch, so the lowering is knee-driven rather than a fold
* stance-foot height, so contacts survive

The adapted motion is therefore the nominal motion plus a local deviation, and the two differ
by exactly the adaptation under test.

**Local, not whole-route.** A clip crouched from frame zero cannot demonstrate a decision made
from what the robot sees, because the obstacle is not visible when the crouch begins -- such a
pair can only support map-conditioned selection. Centring the adaptation on the obstacle
station in route-progress coordinates makes the onset late enough to be a response.

**Clearance is measured on collision-capsule surfaces**, never on a joint position or the root
height. The G1's own half-width runs from 0.273 m with arms tucked to 0.664 m at peak arm
swing, so a joint-centre proxy is wrong in both directions depending on the pose.

#: Fraction of waist_pitch's range the adapted clip may end at. The waist is the most
#: efficient lever on the silhouette -- 109 mm per radian against the squat's 64 at the same
#: excursion, because the capsule that sets the peak is torso_link and there is no neck joint
#: to pitch instead -- and it was excluded from earlier versions for a reason that does not
#: survive inspection: the *generated* crouches rode its limit, holding +0.521 rad against a
#: +0.520 bound on every frame. Riding a limit is the problem, not using the joint. The bound
#: here is therefore on the resulting *value*, not on the change: a clip already at +0.294 rad
#: gets only the headroom that remains.
#:
#: Off by default, for two reasons. The guidance this operator was built to asks for a crouch that
#: is knee-driven and holds torso pitch near nominal, penalising waist use heavily; and the crouch
#: that the matched overhead 2x2 verified moves the waist by exactly 0.000 rad. Enabling this by
#: default meant the operator in the repository no longer reproduced the clip physics had checked,
#: which is the more expensive of the two problems. Measured contribution when enabled: 12.9 mm of

DEFAULT_RAMP = 0.45

#: degrees of whole-arm rotation -- to hit a 100 mm width reduction, destabilised the robot and
#: put it into a wall at 114 N. The motion that worked used 0.282 rad. A geometric objective with
#: no bound on the means is not an operator, it is a search, and it will find something unusable.
#:
#: This bound is per operator, because one number derived from the tuck's failure was applied to
#: both and silently forbade a crouch that works. The crouch verified by the matched overhead 2x2
#: moves its knees 0.994 rad, and a strength sweep put the crouch's trackability boundary between
#: 1.05 and 1.31 rad; a 0.40 cap would have prevented that family from existing. The two operators
#: move different masses against different support, so they do not share a limit.
MAX_TUCK_EXCURSION_RAD = 0.40
#: Set below every crouch excursion SONIC has been observed to hold, with margin.
#:
#: Measured across three nominals, drift magnitude rises monotonically with knee excursion and the
#: boundary sits between 0.994 and 1.000 rad -- a 6 mrad gap:
#:
#:     0.929 rad  accepted  0.015 m/s drift
#:     0.936 rad  accepted  0.025 m/s
#:     0.994 rad  accepted  0.100 m/s
#:     1.000 rad  REJECTED  0.225 m/s, pure reference drift with zero contact
#:
#: The previous value of 1.00 was therefore the worst possible choice: the one clip that failed
#: failed *at* the cap, because the cap is what it was pushed to when its target drop was out of
#: reach. Capping lower makes such a clip under-deliver its target -- reported honestly through

    The symmetric figure takes a maximum over both sides and discards which side produced it.
    Arms swing out of phase, so at any station one side is wide while the other is not, and the
    symmetric number reports the wide one for both -- which dilutes a genuinely one-sided
    reduction to nothing. A one-sided obstacle is the right shape for an arm tuck, so the tuck
    needs the sides kept apart.

    Returns ``(left, right)``, both positive.

    ``side`` selects which arm moves: ``"both"``, ``"left"`` or ``"right"``. A lateral obstacle is
    usually one-sided -- a rack, a cabinet edge, a wall protrusion -- so tucking only the arm
    facing it is the smaller edit: fewer joints leave their reference, the other arm keeps its
    natural swing, and the measurement matches, since a one-sided obstacle is cleared by the
    signed half-width on its own side rather than by the symmetric maximum over both.

    The lateral counterpart to :func:`local_crouch`, and a deliberately easier operator: the
    root, the legs and the contact schedule are untouched, so the only thing a tracker has to
    follow differently is the arms.

    Asking a generator for this produced motions 64 mm *wider* than a plain walk, which is why
    it is constructed here instead. Narrowing is done by scaling the arm joints toward the
    posture they hold at their narrowest, rather than toward zero, since zero is a T-pose in
    some conventions and would widen the robot.
