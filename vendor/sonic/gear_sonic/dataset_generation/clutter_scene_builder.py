"""Build a cluttered indoor scene *around* a known-good motion path.

The inversion that makes this work
----------------------------------

The first approach was: fix a scene, then search for a placement where the motion
fits. That is placement-limited -- most references collide, and the surviving
episodes walk through mostly empty space, which is not the data anyone wants.

Turn it around. The motion is known first, so its swept corridor is known first.
Generate the furniture *around* that corridor: everything is placed outside the
corridor by at least the required clearance, and preferentially just outside it.
The result is a densely cluttered room in which the recorded episode is
traversable **by construction**, with the robot threading between real obstacles
rather than crossing an empty floor.

Guarantees
----------

* Every placed solid clears the executed corridor by ``clearance_m``.
* Solids do not overlap each other or the walls.
* Everything sits inside the room footprint.
* Output is the same primitive USDA subset (``Plane`` floor + axis-aligned
  ``Cube`` solids) that ``scene_asset_preflight`` already validates, so a
  generated scene passes exactly the same gate as a hand-authored one.

Clutter density is reported, not assumed: :class:`ClutterSceneSpec` records how
many solids were placed, how close the nearest one comes to the path, and what
fraction of the free floor they occupy.
