"""Summarise what shape a motion sweeps, so pairs can be proposed without regenerating.

Every counterfactual family so far was built by picking two motions by hand and hoping their
swept volumes separated. That does not scale, and it wastes the corpus: 131 distinct executed
trajectories already exist, and the pair that makes a family is very likely among them.

The obstacle in each regime is a scalar, and what decides whether a motion clears it is one
number:

* **overhead** -- the lowest the robot's silhouette peak ever gets. A shelf below that stops
  it; a shelf above it does not.
* **lateral** -- the narrowest the robot ever is, measured across its direction of travel.
* **floor** -- the trailing foot's swing apex, which is what a bar on the ground has to clear.

Those three numbers are cheap. The expensive part -- binary-searching a real obstacle against
the full capsule model -- then runs only on pairs the cheap screen already likes, which is the
difference between minutes and hours over a corpus this size.

**A large gap is not enough.** Two motions only form a family if they are doing the *same
task*: comparable start, goal, route and duration. A duck walking 2 m straight and a brisk
walk turning through 5 m differ in head height, but a shelf that stops one and passes the
other says nothing about behaviour -- it says the two motions went to different places. The
compatibility check exists to refuse those, and it does most of the work.
