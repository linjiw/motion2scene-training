"""Make a generated crouch reachable, since asking for a reachable one does not work.

Four prompt phrasings were tried, including one written specifically to forbid the failure
("keeping the back straight and never folding forward at the waist"). Every phrasing that
lowers the body pins ``waist_pitch_joint`` at its limit on 100% of frames; the one phrasing
that stays inside the limits produces a motion 8 mm *taller* than a plain walk. The generator's
crouch is a waist fold, and forbidding the fold removes the crouch rather than changing how it
is made. So the crouch has to be constructed.

Two edits do it, and both are small:

**Take the waist off its limit.** The clip holds +0.521 rad against a +0.520 limit for its
entire duration. Setting it to a fraction of the limit keeps the forward lean -- which is
doing real work, since leaning shifts the centre of mass over the feet in a deep squat -- while
leaving the joint headroom.

**Give every joint a margin.** Clamping is not enough and is worth being precise about: a
clamped value sits *exactly at* the limit, and sitting at a limit is what the saturation
screen counts. Clamping converts an out-of-range clip into a fully saturated one. Shrinking
each joint's range toward its centre by a few percent puts it strictly inside instead.

What this does **not** do is re-solve the pose. Root translation is a floating base, so raising
the pelvis moves the whole robot without changing a single joint -- it looks like a shallower
squat and is really a robot hovering. Anything that needs the legs re-solved needs an
optimiser, and this is not one.

**A retargeted reference is not a verified motion.** It is reachable, which is what the screen
measures. Whether SONIC can track it is a rollout's question, and the foot-contact diagnostics
here exist so that an obviously untrackable result can be rejected before spending one.

#: How far to straighten the legs back toward standing, as a fraction. The generated crouch
#: is deep enough that the thighs interpenetrate the pelvis by 1.6 mm in the reference, which
#: the self-intersection screen tolerates because its threshold is 100 mm. Executed, tracking
#: error turns that into 931.5 N of hip-against-pelvis self-contact across 88 frames and the
#: episode is rejected. Straightening the legs 30% removes the interpenetration entirely and

#: available duck gives at a single station, and along the whole route rather than at one.
