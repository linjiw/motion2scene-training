# Design plan: dense, semantic, multi-view indoor humanoid dataset

Status: draft 2026-08-16. Successor plan to
[`design_kimodo_sonic_isaaclab_g1_dataset.md`](design_kimodo_sonic_isaaclab_g1_dataset.md),
which took the pipeline from nothing to 15 validated episodes. This plan covers the
richness axes that dataset does not yet have.

## 0. Where we actually are

Proven and in the repository:

- Kimodo reference -> SONIC physics tracking -> validated LeRobot `synthetic_g1` export.
- 15 episodes x 248 rows, passing schema, latent-parity and semantic evaluation.
- Scene-aware placement, and clutter generated *around* a known-good path
  (21-30% floor occupancy, measured lateral scene contact 0.00 N).
- Acceptance gates that compare against the commanded motion, not absolute thresholds.
- Visual validation that caught debug-marker goal leakage no numeric gate saw.

Honest gaps this plan addresses:

| Gap | Today |
|---|---|
| Clearance model | a single 0.45 m cylinder around the **root**, plus a 0.30 m margin |
| Clutter geometry | 2D footprints only; no vertical structure |
| Motion variety | 2 usable bundled demos: one walk, one bow. No household activity |
| Semantics | furniture proxies have a `kind` string; nothing is exported as a label |
| Views | ego RGB only in the dataset; third-person exists for review only |
| Scene styles | one procedural style, one density setting |
| Motion generation | **blocked**: no `sm_120` PyTorch build, so no new prompts |

## 1. What "great" means for this dataset

The dataset should let a model learn, and let a reviewer verify, that a humanoid:

1. **navigates tight, realistic indoor clutter** without contact,
2. **does human household activity** (reach, wipe, pick up, place, crouch to a low shelf),
3. in scenes whose objects **mean something** (a mop is near a bucket; a plate is on a
   counter, not on the floor),
4. observed from **the views a real robot has** plus the views a human needs to review it,
5. across a **controlled density sweep**, so robustness to clutter can be measured rather
   than assumed.

Every episode must remain physics-validated and provenance-bound. Richness must not cost
the guarantees already established.

## 2. Item A -- true swept-volume clearance (unlocks narrow passages)

**Why.** The current model is a 0.45 m cylinder about the root. That is simultaneously too
conservative and too permissive: too conservative near the feet, where the robot is narrow
and could pass a 0.6 m gap; too permissive around swinging arms and the head, which the
root cylinder does not represent at all. Narrow corridors are unreachable with it.

**What exists.** `motion_cmd.robot_body_pos_w` is `(num_envs, num_bodies, 3)` for all 30
tracked bodies, and the recorder already reads `[:, 0]` for the root. **Per-body positions
are not recorded today** -- that is step one.

**Design.**

1. Extend `TrajectoryRecorderTerm` with `body_pos_w (T, 30, 3)` and `body_names`, matching
   the existing contact-body ordering so contact and geometry index identically.
2. Add `swept_volume.py`: from `body_pos_w`, build a per-frame set of capsules along the
   kinematic links (a sphere per body plus a capsule per parent-child pair), with a
   per-link radius table derived from the G1 collision geometry.
3. Clearance becomes `min over (frame, link, obstacle)` of capsule-to-box distance in 3D,
   replacing the 2D root-cylinder test in both the planner and the acceptance gate.
4. Keep the tracking margin, but apply it to the swept volume rather than a nominal radius.

**Payoff -- and the prediction above was wrong, corrected by measurement.** Implemented
and measured on a real 249-frame walking rollout (see section 11):

| quantity | value |
|---|---|
| swept half-width, arms tucked | **0.273 m** |
| swept half-width, median | **0.377 m** |
| swept half-width, peak arm swing | **0.664 m** |
| old uniform assumption | 0.450 m |

So a *uniform* narrow corridor of 0.35-0.45 m, as this plan originally claimed, would be
**unsafe**: the robot exceeds it on 22 of 249 frames. The old 0.45 m root cylinder was
optimistic by 0.056 m on that episode, and 0.45 + 0.30 = 0.75 m was under-specified at
peak swing, where the true requirement is 0.964 m.

The real unlock is therefore a **per-frame, spatially varying corridor**: 0.573 m where
the arms are tucked (24% tighter than the old uniform value) and 0.964 m where they swing
(21% wider than it). Tighter *and* safer, in different places along the same path.

**Risk.** Under-approximating link radii turns a false-accept into a real collision.
Mitigation: derive radii from the G1 USD collision meshes, not by hand, and cross-check
that the swept volume predicts the contact frames already recorded -- we have ground truth
from `robot_contact_force_w`, so the model can be validated against observed contacts
before it is trusted to license narrower gaps.

## 3. Item B -- vertical clutter, not just footprints

**Why.** Everything today is a floor-standing box, so the only navigation skill exercised
is planar avoidance. Real indoor space is layered.

**Design.** Three occupancy bands, checked in 3D against the swept volume:

| Band | Height | Examples | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Floor | 0 - 0.25 m | rug edge, cable tray, low box, pet bowl | must not intersect foot/ankle capsules |
| Body | 0.25 - 1.4 m | table, counter, chair, open drawer, mop bucket | must not intersect torso/arm capsules |
| Overhead | 1.4 - 2.2 m | wall cabinet, hanging lamp, shelf, doorway header | must not intersect head/shoulder capsules |

Two additions make this interesting rather than merely 3D:

- **Cantilevered geometry** -- a table top or wall shelf whose footprint overlaps the
  corridor while its *free space underneath* does not. The robot walks under a shelf its
  2D footprint would have blocked. This is the case the current 2D model cannot express at
  all, and it is common in homes.
- **Per-band density knobs**, so a scene can be floor-cluttered but overhead-clear, or the
  reverse.

**Validation.** The static preflight must gain a 3D route check; it currently rejects any
solid whose vertical extent overlaps `[support_z, support_z + robot_height)` regardless of
whether the robot's *body at that point* is actually there.

## 4. Item C -- semantic objects and labels

**Why.** "Cluttered" is not the same as "meaningful". A model cannot learn a household task
from anonymous boxes, and an evaluator cannot check semantic grounding that was never
recorded.

**Design.**

1. **Object catalog** with `category`, `affordance`, `typical_support` (floor / counter /
   wall / ceiling), size distribution, and a `semantic_id`.
2. **Placement grammar** rather than uniform sampling: objects are placed relative to
   *anchors*. A kitchen anchor spawns counter + sink + fridge; small items (plate, cup,
   bottle) go **on** counters, not on the floor; a cleaning anchor spawns mop, bucket, bin.
   This is what makes a scene read as a room rather than a warehouse of cubes.
3. **Export semantics.** Add to the episode record: per-object `semantic_id`, category,
   pose, and support relation; plus, when the renderer supports it, an instance-segmentation
   sidecar aligned to the ego frames. The existing `synthetic_g1` profile stays unchanged
   for training features -- semantics are added as metadata/non-training features, per the
   original contract's rule.

**Note on assets.** Real meshes remain future work (see section 7). The catalog and grammar
are asset-independent: proxies today, textured assets later, same semantic ids. Building the
grammar first means swapping assets does not invalidate the labels.

## 5. Item D -- household-activity motions

**Why.** The dataset is currently *walking*. The stated goal is home cleaning and human-style
household work.

**Blocked on:** Kimodo generation. The local environment has no `sm_120` PyTorch build for
the RTX 5090, so no new prompt has ever been sampled; everything to date re-exports bundled
demos. **This is the single highest-value unblock in this plan** -- without it, motion
variety is capped at two usable clips.

**Design once unblocked.**

1. Prompt families: *sweeping the floor*, *wiping a table*, *picking up an object and
   carrying it*, *crouching to a low shelf*, *opening a cabinet*, *pushing a chair in*.
2. Kimodo end-effector constraints to place hands at task-relevant poses, which the design
   doc's section 10 already anticipates.
3. **Motion-conditioned scene generation**: the clutter builder already places furniture
   around a path; extend it to place the *task object* at the end-effector target. If the
   motion reaches to a point, put a table there. This is the same inversion that made
   clutter work, applied to manipulation.
4. Keep contact-rich manipulation out of scope until section 10 of the parent doc is
   addressed; the first step is reach-and-gesture near objects, not grasping.

**Interim, unblocked:** the two curved motions (`05_root_path`, `06_root_waypoints`) are
already richer navigation than what is in the dataset and fail only on a provisional
tracking threshold. Calibrating that threshold adds behaviours today at zero generation cost.

## 6. Item E -- multi-view capture

**Why.** One ego camera is what the robot has; it is not enough to review, and not enough to
train a model that reasons about a scene.

**Design.** Per-episode view set, all sharing one clock:

| View | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ego RGB 640x480 @ 50 Hz | training | done |
| wrist RGB (L/R) | manipulation phase | env supports it; not wired |
| third-person chase 1280x720 | human review | works; review-only, not exported |
| overhead orthographic | layout/coverage review | `overview_camera` exists |
| ego depth + instance segmentation | semantic supervision | sidecar, per parent doc 5.4 |

Rendering every view for every episode is wasteful. Follow the parent doc's two-pass design:
physics first, then **replay accepted trajectories** through the render pass with whatever
view set that episode needs.

## 7. Item F -- density sweep and scene styles

**Why.** "Cluttered" should be a measured axis, not an adjective.

**Design.** Parameterise the generator by a `density` level with recorded metrics
(occupancy, min corridor width, object count per band):

| Level | Floor occupancy | Min corridor | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sparse` | 5-10% | 1.2 m | open room, few landmarks |
| `moderate` | 15-25% | 0.9 m | furnished living space (today's output) |
| `dense` | 30-40% | 0.7 m | busy room, frequent detours |
| `tight` | 40%+ | 0.45-0.55 m | requires the swept-volume model from item A |

Plus **style presets** -- living room, kitchen, bedroom, hallway, office -- each an anchor
set and object mix in the item-C grammar. Split by style and layout so held-out evaluation
means something.

## 8. Item G -- photorealistic assets

Deferred deliberately, not forgotten. The NVIDIA Omniverse asset server is reachable from
this machine (verified HTTP 200). What adopting it costs:

- the dependency-free preflight validates only `Plane` + axis-aligned `Cube`; real meshes
  need a USD-native geometry gate to replace or supplement it;
- collision approximation (convex decomposition) per asset, and a check that the collision
  proxy matches the visual mesh closely enough that clearance guarantees still hold;
- a licence and redistribution record per asset, per the parent doc's section 5.1 rule;
- render cost, which the two-pass design already anticipates.

Sequencing: geometry and semantics determine whether the *navigation and task* data is any
good. Textures determine what the ego camera sees, which matters for sim-to-real transfer.
Layout first is deliberate; this is the natural next milestone after items A-C.

## 9. Proposed order

Each step is independently useful and leaves the dataset valid.

1. **A1 -- DONE.** `body_pos_w` and `body_quat_w` are recorded (orientation is required
   to place body-local capsules; positions alone only support bounding spheres).
2. **A2 -- DONE.** Swept-volume model built from the G1's 29 collision capsules and
   validated against independently recorded physics before being used to narrow anything.
3. **B** -- vertical bands and cantilevered geometry, 3D preflight.
4. **F** -- density sweep, now that narrow corridors are safe.
5. **C** -- semantic catalog, placement grammar, semantic export.
6. **E** -- multi-view render pass over accepted trajectories.
7. **D** -- household motions, the moment Kimodo generation is restored.
8. **G** -- photorealistic assets.

Items 1-6 are unblocked today. Item 7 is gated on an environment fix. Item 8 is gated on the
scene-contract work in section 8.

## 10. What must not regress

The guarantees already paid for, which every item above must preserve:

- physics-validated acceptance with reason codes, compared against the commanded motion;
- `action.motion_token` encoder-equivalence to the deployment `token_state`;
- typed `EpisodeRequest -> GenerationResult -> ConversionResult` provenance bound to the
  runtime capture;
- no simulator overlay in any exported observation;
- split-safe scene/layout grouping;
- honest reporting: quarantined rejects keep their reason codes, and provisional thresholds
  stay labelled provisional.


## 11. Implementation log

### 11.1 A1 -- per-body pose recording (done)

`TrajectoryRecorderTerm` now stores `body_pos_w (T, 30, 3)`, `body_quat_w (T, 30, 4)` and
`body_names`, in the same scene-local frame as `root_pos_w` (verified: the pelvis column
matches `root_pos_w` to 0.000000 m).

Orientation is recorded as well as position because the collision geometry is defined in
each link's local frame; positions alone would only support conservative bounding spheres,
which are too coarse to narrow anything.

**A landmine worth stating.** The articulation body order and the contact-sensor body order
**differ at 27 of 30 positions**, though they cover the same set. Indexing `body_pos_w`
against `robot_contact_force_w` positionally would silently pair the wrong link with the
wrong force. Everything downstream aligns by name.

### 11.2 A2 -- swept-volume model (done)

[`swept_volume.py`](../gear_sonic/dataset_generation/swept_volume.py) places the G1's 29
primitive collision capsules -- covering the 14 links that have collision geometry -- in
world frame from the recorded pose.

Geometry source: the Kimodo G1 MJCF, whose link structure was already verified against this
repository's G1 (same 29 actuated joints, order, axes, limits, parent links, transforms).
The repository's own `g1_29dof.xml` defines collisions as meshes with no usable radii. The
numbers are transcribed into the module so it does not depend on an external checkout.

A satisfying cross-check fell out: **exactly those 14 links carry collision geometry, and
exactly those links were ever observed to register contact force.** The other 16
articulation bodies reported identically zero force in every rollout because they have no
collision shape -- which also explains the "24 of 30 bodies are all-zero" observation from
the contact-decomposition work.

**Validation against independent ground truth**, done before the model was allowed to
license narrower gaps:

1. *Floor reconstruction.* Foot capsule surfaces reach **z = -0.0008 m**. Nothing in the
   capsule table knows where the floor is; the model recovers the ground plane to
   sub-millimetre from body pose alone, which confirms the rotation and offset placement.
2. *Agreement with recorded contact.* On an episode with **0.000 N** of recorded lateral
   scene contact, the model predicts **1.070 m** of clearance -- positive, consistent. The
   nearest link is `right_wrist_yaw_link`, precisely the body the root cylinder ignored.
3. *Disagreement with the old model, in the direction the measurements predict.* The root
   cylinder assumed 1.576 - 0.45 = **1.126 m**; the true surface clearance is **1.070 m**.
   The old model was optimistic by 0.056 m, matching the measured 0.514 m wrist reach
   against its 0.45 m assumption.

### 11.3 Per-frame corridors in the clutter builder (done)

`build_clutter_scene` accepts `per_point_clearance_m`, so the corridor follows the robot
instead of being a tube sized for its worst moment. Measured against the uniform model on
the same path and seed:

| | uniform 0.75 m | per-frame swept |
|---|---|---|
| nearest obstacle | 0.762 m | **0.643 m** |
| median obstacle distance | 1.426 m | **1.258 m** |
| pieces placed | 27 | 26 |
| floor occupancy | 27.1% | 24.9% |

Furniture comes 12 cm closer at the tightest point and 17 cm closer on average. Piece count
and occupancy are slightly *lower*, and that is the model working correctly rather than a
regression: this motion swings its arms hard, so the per-frame requirement rises to 0.964 m
at peak swing, and the space the corridor gives back where the robot is slim does not fully
pay for the space it correctly reclaims where the robot is wide. A motion with tucked arms
would gain more.

### 11.4 Item B -- vertical bands and cantilevered geometry (done)

**Bands come from measurement, not assumption.** The recorded swept volume tops out at
**1.317 m** (the torso; the G1 collision set has no head capsule) and bottoms at -0.001 m.
The >= 1.4 m band was occupied on **0% of frames**, so a solid whose underside sits above
that can hang directly over the corridor and be walked under.

Catalog now carries `z_base` and a `band`:

| Band | Archetypes | Rule enforced by test |
|---|---|---|
| floor | LowCrate, PetBowl | 0.05-0.30 m tall, never elevated -- a trip hazard, not a torso obstacle |
| body | sofa, table, chair, shelf, counter, fridge ... | >= 0.3 m tall |
| overhead | WallShelf, WallCabinet, CeilingLamp | underside >= 1.40 m, above the measured 1.317 m top |

**Placement is now 3D.** `build_clutter_scene` accepts a `swept_cloud` and tests candidate
boxes against the robot's actual collision volume via `box_clearance_to_cloud`, which agrees
with the exact segment method to 0.0000 m at 2.8 ms per query. Cantilevered pieces do not
reserve floor footprint, so furniture may stand underneath them, and the overlap test
becomes 3D so two pieces may share a footprint at different heights.

**The preflight is band-aware.** It previously treated any solid overlapping
`[support_z, support_z + robot_height)` as a route blocker, which rejects a wall shelf on
principle. Scenes may now declare `route_swept_height_m` -- the measured swept top plus a
margin -- and only solids intruding below that block the route. Absent the field the old
conservative behaviour is unchanged.

**Result, validated in physics:**

| | value |
|---|---|
| pieces | 34 (4 floor / 22 body / 8 overhead) |
| floor occupancy | **38%** (was 24.9% in 2D) |
| cantilevered pieces over the corridor | **4** |
| preflight route clearance | **0.492 m** (was 0.75-0.80 m in the 2D packages) |
| recorded lateral scene contact | **0.000 N** |
| episode acceptance | accepted, 249 frames |

Furniture is a third closer to the path than the 2D packages allowed, at a third higher
density, with four pieces hanging over the walking corridor -- and the robot still records
zero scene contact.

### 11.5 Three bugs this work exposed

Worth recording, because two of them were silently wrong before Item B forced a 3D check:

1. **Swept cloud frame.** The cloud arrives in the trajectory's frame while the room is
   built around a *recentred* path. Testing collisions in the wrong frame placed furniture
   on top of the route; the preflight caught it.
2. **Scene-start metric.** The manifest recorded `-centre` as the motion's scene start. That
   is only correct when the caller already canonicalised the path, and silently put the
   robot **outside the room** when it did not -- visible as a blank ego view and a top-down
   path at x in [4.1, 7.6] in a room of +/-3.5 m. It is now the recentred first path point.
3. **Floor containment precision.** The USDA writer emits the floor at `{:.3f}` while the
   manifest carried full float precision, so walkable bounds could exceed the authored floor
   by 0.036 mm and the package failed its own gate. Room dimensions are now rounded to the
   writer's precision. This had made the whole `g1_clutter_curved` package invalid without
   anyone noticing, because it had never been preflighted.

### 11.6 Item F -- density sweep (done, validated in physics)

`DENSITY_PRESETS` turns clutter density into a measured axis. Each preset fixes the safety
margin over the robot's per-frame swept half-width, the number of pieces to attempt, and how
close to the corridor they may be sampled. Achieved occupancy and clearance are reported per
scene rather than assumed.

Same motion, same seed, four levels, each rolled out under physics:

| preset | margin | pieces | occupancy | 2D route clearance | min 3D clearance | lateral scene contact | accepted |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sparse | 0.60 m | 12 | 13% | 0.986 m | 0.664 m | **0.000 N** | yes |
| moderate | 0.30 m | 26 | 28% | 0.673 m | 0.379 m | **0.000 N** | yes |
| dense | 0.20 m | 31 | 31% | 0.463 m | 0.209 m | **0.000 N** | yes |
| tight | 0.12 m | 33 | 34% | 0.287 m | 0.124 m | **0.000 N** | yes |

**4/4 accepted with zero scene contact**, including `tight` at a 0.12 m margin -- which is
*below* the measured p95 path error of 0.22-0.23 m. That is not luck, and the reason is worth
stating because it is the load-bearing idea behind the whole clutter approach: the scene is
generated against the **executed** swept volume, not the reference. The robot deterministically
reproduces that trajectory, so tracking error is already baked into the geometry the clutter
was built around. The margin only has to absorb simulation nondeterminism, which is evidently
far smaller than the tracking error.

**One honest consequence.** At `tight` the 2D route clearance (0.287 m) falls below a nominal
0.45 m body radius, and the preflight rejected the scene until the declared
`route_clearance_radius_m` was changed from a nominal cylinder to the **measured minimum swept
half-width** for that route (0.273 m), with `route_clearance_model: swept_volume_per_frame`
recorded alongside. For such scenes the 2D route check is a necessary backstop only; the
authoritative checks are the per-frame 3D test at generation and recorded physics.

### 11.7 Item E -- multi-view capture (partly done)

Isaac's recorder writes one camera per run, so each view is a separate pass over the same
deterministic motion; frames line up because the physics is identical.
[`render_multiview.sh`](../scripts/research/render_multiview.sh) drives them.

| view | status |
|---|---|
| ego (head, 640x480 @ 50 Hz) | works -- this is the trained observation |
| chase (third person, 1280x720) | works, with a caveat below |
| overhead (top-down render) | **broken**, see below |
| wrist (left/right) | cameras added to the env config; render pass not yet verified |

**Chase camera clips into furniture.** At the default `eval_camera_offset` of `[2, 2, 1]` it
ends up inside a solid in a dense room and the video goes blank part-way. Raising it to
`[3, 3, 2.5]` helped but did not fix it; a dense-scene chase camera needs collision-aware
placement, not a fixed offset.

**Overhead render is broken and I could not fix it.** `overview_camera` produces 249 frames of
uniform grey (pixel std 0.00). It is authored at `pos=(0, 0, 50)` with an identity rotation,
which points it away from the scene; rotating it to look down and lowering it to room height
did not help, so the cause is elsewhere -- most likely that `/World/OverviewCamera` is a global
prim outside the env namespace and is not driven by the recorder's `group_camera` path. I
reverted the speculative change rather than ship an unverified fix, and left a note at the
definition. **The matplotlib top-down plots are the working overhead review path** and are
arguably better for this purpose: they draw obstacle footprints, the executed and reference
paths, and start/end markers to scale.

**Wrist cameras** are now configurable (`cameras.wrist_cameras: true`, attached to
`left/right_wrist_yaw_link`) and are deliberately *not* added to the trained observation set --
changing the registered `synthetic_g1` modality is a separate decision from being able to
record the imagery. The render pass has not been verified end to end.

Also fixed while here: the ego camera was authored with `debug_vis=True`, which draws a frustum
marker. It is now off by default for the same reason `motion.debug_vis` must be off when
recording -- viewport decoration has no business in a training observation.

### 11.8 Next

Item C (semantic catalog and placement grammar) is the largest remaining piece and is
unblocked. Item D still waits on Kimodo generation. Item G (photorealistic assets) waits on a
USD-native geometry gate to replace the primitive-subset preflight.
