# Multi-obstacle LfLH for humanoid counterfactuals: what works, and what does not

> ## RETRACTION, 2026-08-27
>
> **Addenda 2 and 3 of this report are withdrawn.** Two independent audits, prompted by a reviewer
> noticing that the robot appears to overlap obstacles in the rendered videos, found that it does.
> The reviewer was right and the reports were wrong. Specifically:
>
> * **The explained motion physically intersects an obstacle in 21 of 24 shipped scenes** (median
>   34 mm, max 773 mm), measured by true capsule-to-box distance. The crouch "wins" only because
>   the nominal is blocked *more*, not because the scene admits the crouch.
> * **The box the renderer labels "binding" is inert.** Acting alone it selects the *nominal* in
>   24/24. It sits at 1.75 m -- exactly the ceiling of the height parameterisation -- 33 cm above a
>   standing head. The box doing the work is an unlabelled 0.81 x 2.40 x 1.02 m slab.
> * **The "plausibility 1.00" claim was measured on that inert box.** Across all 120 sampled
>   obstacles only 40% satisfy `PlausibleShape`, and the slab that actually discriminates satisfies
>   it in 0/24.
> * **The clearance term was dead code.** `relu(blockedness + 0.05)` where blockedness is a
>   softplus and therefore strictly positive: the `relu` never fired, the loss had no reachable
>   minimum, and its only escape direction was height -- which is what drove every obstacle to the
>   ceiling.
> * **The decoder had a blind spot.** Gates multiplied the depth *before* the softplus, so a 1.6 m
>   wall standing across the walking path scored 0.008976 against 0.008394 for the same wall ten
>   metres in the sky. Geometrically intersecting and comfortably clear were indistinguishable.
> * **The input-ablation control was confounded.** It overwrote `extents`, which is both the
>   encoder input and the scored candidate. Re-scoring the *unchanged* scenes against the corpus
>   mean moves the match rate 1.00 -> 0.75 on its own -- a larger artifact than the effect claimed.
>   Corrected, the operator-conditioned result is **0.986 vs 0.979** (3/12 clips differ, p = 0.25),
>   not 0.986 vs 0.877. **The amortisation win does not survive.**
> * **There was no train/test split.** Every number in Addenda 1-3 is in-sample on 12-24 clips.
> * Several headline figures came from throwaway scripts, were never committed, and no checkpoint
>   was saved, so they cannot be re-evaluated.
>
> What survives: the decoder *does* decide (an empty scene selects the nominal, a wide overhead bar
> the crouch, a left obstacle the left tuck), and the dual objective works -- relaxing the scene by
> 10 cm restores the nominal in 23/24. The mechanism is real. The measurements built on the
> envelope decoder are not.
>
> Both audits independently named the same highest-value fix: **a signed clearance in metres,
> computed against real capsule geometry.** That is now implemented
> (`hallucination/sdf_decoder.py`, `scripts/research/hallucination/train_lflh_sdf.py`) with a
> held-out split, and it is verified to separate the cases the old decoder confused: a wall across
> the path scores -0.200 m, the same wall in the sky +8.670 m. Numbers from it supersede everything

## 1. What is different from the retracted attempt

| retracted | now |
|---|---|
| decoder was a soft indicator of a closed-form interval | decoder **re-decides** which of 8 candidate motions the scene prefers |
| 2 parameters, one overhead face | **5 obstacles x 6 parameters**, any direction |
| coordinate anchored on the answer's lower edge | no anchor derived from any feasibility answer |
| `min_log_sigma = -6`, and the headline was that clamp | `min_log_sigma = -20`; a reported sigma cannot be its own floor |
| no entropy/KL — collapse was a theorem | genuine Gaussian KL carrying `-log sigma`, plus obstacle-obstacle repulsion |
| compared against uniform-on-the-answer | compared against **random-from-prior**, **input-ablated**, and **no-KL** |

**Obstacles are now directional.** `motion_envelope.py` measures up/left/right body extents per
route station in the executed route frame. Overhead binding requires the box to cover the route
centreline; lateral binding requires it to sit off to one side and straddle mid-body height.

Finding that distinction took fixing a real bug: a waist-height side obstacle was being scored as
overhead, so every obstacle blocked every candidate and the decoder always returned the nominal.

Unit tests verify the decoder decides: an empty scene selects the nominal (the cheapest), a wide
overhead bar selects the crouch, a **left** obstacle selects the **left** arm tuck, and a right
obstacle the right one. That is the sidedness the previous videos could never show.

## 2. Per-clip: it works, for edits that open a wide enough band

One model per clip, 8 real clips, 500 steps, one observed edit each:

| observed edit | scenes selecting it |
|---|---:|
| `tuck_left_070` | **1.00** |
| `tuck_right_040` | **1.00** |
| `tuck_right_070` | **1.00** |
| `crouch_040`, `crouch_055`, `crouch_070`, `tuck_left_040` | 0.00 |
| mean | 0.375 |

With a softer decoder (`temperature_m` 0.02 → 0.15) the deepest crouch recovers:

| `temperature_m` | crouch_040 | crouch_055 | crouch_070 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.02 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| 0.06 | 0.03 | 0.00 | **1.00** |
| 0.15 | 0.14 | 0.00 | **1.00** |

**The failures are optimisation, not representation, and that is demonstrated rather than
asserted.** Hand-placing an overhead bar at the midpoint of the nominal/crouch gap selects
`crouch_040` at every obstacle width tested (0.04–0.80 m half-length). The target is reachable; the
optimiser does not find it from a random start, because outside the band both candidates are
equally blocked or equally clear and the gradient is flat.

**One variable explains the pattern: the width of the band the edit opens.** `crouch_070` separates
the body by ~102 mm at its best station and succeeds; `crouch_040` separates by ~65 mm and fails.
That is the same quantity the closed-form solver calls the executed window `|W|`, so a narrow
window is hard for the hallucinator to find for the same reason it is hard for physics to deliver.

## 3. Across clips: it fails, and its own control says why

One model over 24 clips, targets rotated across crouches and both tucks:

| arm | scenes selecting the observed motion | station sd | lateral sd | side entropy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **learned** | **9.3%** | 5.74 | 0.498 | 0.647 |
| learned, **input ablated** (fed the corpus-mean profile) | **27.2%** | 5.73 | 0.497 | 0.649 |
| random from the prior | 11.5% | 3.23 | 0.460 | 0.760 |
| learned without KL | 0.0% | 7.35 | 0.485 | 0.673 |

The learned arm is **beaten by random obstacles, and beaten badly by its own input-ablation**.
Feeding the model the corpus mean instead of each clip's own profile makes it three times better.
Tripling the training budget (700 → 2500 steps) makes it *worse*, 9.3% → 2.7%, so this is not
under-training:

| steps | learned | input ablated | random |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 700 | 9.3% | 27.2% | 11.5% |
| 2500 | **2.7%** | 22.3% | 11.6% |

**Conditioning on the trajectory is currently anti-informative.** This is the same shape of finding
as the archetype kernel earlier in this project: a model asked to condition on features that barely
distinguish its inputs does worse than ignoring them. The per-clip profiles differ mainly in one
channel over a few stations — a tucked arm changes the lateral extent by 40–70 mm out of ~350 mm —
and the encoder does not extract it.

Note the input-ablation control is exactly what exposed the retracted version as a constant. Here
it does its job again, in the other direction: the model *is* input-dependent, and that dependence
hurts.

## 4. Honest status

**Established.** A multi-obstacle hallucinator with a decoder that genuinely re-decides can place
obstacles that make a *specific, named* edit the preferred one — including choosing the correct
side for a left versus right arm tuck. That is the mechanism the paper needs, and it is verified
per direction by test and per clip on real data.

**Not established.** That a single model amortises this across clips. At 24 clips it loses to
random and to its own ablation. Until it beats both, no claim about a learned scene distribution
should appear in the paper.

**Diagnosed.** Success tracks the width of the band the edit opens. The narrow-band failures are
optimisation, proven by hand-placement recovering the target.

## 5. What to do next, in order

1. **Anneal the decoder temperature** during training — soft for gradient flow, sharpened for a
   faithful decision. LfLH anneals its own loss weights over 1000 epochs; we do not anneal at all.
   The 0.02 → 0.15 sweep already shows the direction.
2. **Initialise from the closed form.** We can compute a feasible overhead band exactly. Starting
   the obstacle mean inside it and letting the model refine turns a search problem into a
   refinement problem, and is legitimate provided the initialisation is reported.
3. **Train per-clip, then amortise.** Per-clip optimisation already works for wide bands. Fit the
   encoder to the per-clip solutions as a supervised regression, rather than asking it to discover
   them through the decoder.
4. **Only then report a distribution.** With reconstruction rate *and* diversity, against
   random-from-prior and input-ablated, at more than one training budget.

# Addendum, 2026-08-27: seeding and annealing, and what the band width predicts

The previous section diagnosed the per-clip failures as optimisation rather than representation and
proposed two fixes. Both were implemented and ablated. **One works, one does not, and which is
which is predictable in advance.**

## The ablation

Six clips, 400 steps, one observed edit each, evaluated at the sharp decoder. "Minimum edits" are
the shallowest of each kind (`crouch_040`, `tuck_left_040`, `tuck_right_040`); "deep edits" are the
deepest (`crouch_070`, `tuck_left_070`).

| | baseline | anneal only | seed only | seed + anneal |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **minimum edits** | **0.505** | 0.047 | 0.307 | 0.198 |
| **deep edits** | 0.831 | **1.000** | 0.503 | 0.508 |

## What separates the two rows is the band, and it is computable beforehand

The width of the band an edit opens against its *cheapest rival* — the same quantity the closed-form
solver calls `|W|`, generalised to left and right:

| target | band vs cheapest rival | rivals |
|---|---:|---:|
| `crouch_040` | **81.1 mm** | 1 |
| `tuck_left_040` | 47.9 mm | 3 |
| `tuck_left_070` | 40.5 mm | 7 |
| `crouch_055` | 23.3 mm | 4 |
| `crouch_070` | **22.4 mm** | 5 |

A minimum edit only has to beat the nominal, so its band is wide. A deep edit has to beat every
shallower edit of the same kind as well, so its band is narrow — which is the lexicographic
minimum-edit rule expressed as geometry, and exactly what `regret = xi * |W|` says.

**Annealing helps narrow bands and destroys wide ones.** Deep edits go 0.831 → **1.000**; minimum
edits collapse 0.505 → **0.047**. The mechanism is consistent: the soft phase supplies gradient
where the sharp loss is flat, which is what a narrow band needs. Where the band is already wide the
search was never the problem, and the soft phase instead lets the model settle on placements that
fail once the decision is made faithful again.

**This is a usable rule, not a curiosity.** The band width is known *before* training, from the
envelopes alone. So the closed-form analysis does not merely compete with the learned machinery —
it configures it: anneal when the band is narrow, do not when it is wide.

## Seeding fails, and the likely reason is the one that sank the retracted version

Closed-form seeding hurt both regimes (0.505 → 0.307, 0.831 → 0.503) despite the seed being good on
its own — seed-only accuracy with no training at all is 8/8 on `crouch_040` and 7/8 on
`tuck_left_040`.

The probable mechanism is in how the seed is installed: the output layer's weights are zeroed so
that the initial output *is* the seed. That also zeroes the gradient path to the encoder, so the
model begins as a constant function of its input and has no pressure to stop being one. That is the
same failure the retracted experiment shipped, arrived at from the opposite direction. It is a
hypothesis, not a measurement — the test would be to seed only the bias while leaving the weights
at their usual initialisation, and to report the input-ablation control alongside.

## Where this leaves LfLH for the paper

**Working, verified:** a multi-obstacle hallucinator with a decoder that genuinely re-decides can
place obstacles that make a specific named edit preferred, choosing the correct side for a left
versus right arm tuck. Per clip, with annealing on narrow bands, deep edits reach a **1.000**
selection rate.

**Not working:** amortising across clips. The learned arm still loses to random and to its own
input-ablation, and seeding — the intervention meant to help — makes the input-dependence worse.

**The honest headline** is not "LfLH works" or "LfLH fails". It is that **the inverse problem is
well-posed exactly where the band is wide, and the band is computable in closed form.** A learned
hallucinator is worth its cost in the narrow-band regime, where search is genuinely hard; in the
wide-band regime the closed form already answers the question and the learner adds variance. That
is a sharper claim than either paper it comes from makes, and it is supported by an ablation with
the controls stated.

## Next

1. **Seed the bias only**, leaving the encoder's gradient path intact, and re-run with the
   input-ablation control. This is the direct test of the hypothesis above.
2. **Gate annealing on the computed band width** rather than applying it uniformly, and re-run the
   24-clip amortisation with that rule.
3. **Only then** report a distribution, with reconstruction rate and diversity, against
   random-from-prior and input-ablated, at more than one training budget.

# Addendum 2, 2026-08-27: pair conditioning, the dual objective, and operator conditioning

Acting on external guidance recommending Formulation C (pair-conditioned counterfactual
hallucination), a dual hard/easy objective, a minimality term, and **separate operator-conditioned
models**. Three of the four changed the result; one did not.

## 1. Pair conditioning alone does not fix amortisation

The encoder previously saw only the observed motion, so it had to infer *which edit this was* from
absolute extents. It now encodes the nominal and the observed motion with a shared encoder and
fuses them as `[Z0, Z1, Z1-Z0, |Z1-Z0|]`, making the edit explicit.

| arm | selects observed motion |
|---|---:|
| learned, pair-conditioned | 1.5% |
| learned, input-ablated | 21.9% |
| random from prior | 11.6% |

Still beaten by its own ablation over 24 clips with rotating targets. **Handing the model the edit
explicitly was not sufficient.**

## 2. The dual objective needed retuning, and then works per clip

Adding the easy-scene term (with obstacles relaxed, the *nominal* must be preferred again) and a
minimality term initially broke per-clip training, because the weights were too aggressive:

| easy weight | minimality | steps | crouch / tuck_left / tuck_right | mean |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| 1.0 | 0.05 | 260 | 0.57 / 1.00 / 0.08 | 0.55 |
| 1.0 | 0.05 | 600 | 0.00 / 0.00 / 1.00 | 0.33 |
| **0.3** | **0.02** | **600** | **0.95 / 0.98 / 1.00** | **0.98** |

At the tuned weights the full counterfactual objective — hard scene prefers the edit, easy scene
prefers the nominal, minimality keeps the face tight — is satisfied on all three edit directions.

## 3. Operator conditioning is what makes amortisation work

Training one model per operator, 12 clips each, rather than one model that must also discover which
*kind* of obstacle to emit:

| operator | learned | input-ablated | reconstruction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **crouch** | **0.986** | 0.877 | 0.290 |
| **tuck_left** | **0.700** | 0.653 | 0.639 |
| tuck_right | 0.014 | 0.007 | 3.587 |

**For the first time the learned arm beats its own input-ablation** — on two of three operators.
The mixed-operator model never did. `tuck_right` fails to amortise even though it succeeds per clip
(1.00 in §2), so that is an optimisation failure specific to one operator rather than a
representational limit.

## 4. Generated scenes: the mechanism works, plausibility is a separate problem

`render_lflh_scenes.py` samples obstacles from the trained hallucinator and replays the motion pair
through them. Every box is the model's own output.

**With loose size ranges the model succeeds completely and produces implausible scenes.**
Reconstruction 0.290, **match rate 24/24 = 1.00** — every sampled scene makes the crouch the
preferred motion. But the obstacles are 1.6 m cubes: they satisfy the decoder and look nothing like
anything a person would duck under. `docs/source/_static/lflh_scenes_relaxed/`.

**With physical per-axis ranges the scenes look right and the model stops converging.** Constraining
the face to be thin along route (0.03–0.35 m) and vertically (0.02–0.30 m) while allowing width
across route (0.04–1.20 m) produces plank-like boxes — 0.06 x 2.40 x 0.60 m — but:

| steps | reconstruction | match rate |
|---|---:|---:|
| 900 | 3.233 | 0.00 |
| 2600 | 1.412 | 0.08 |

It is converging, and slowly. `docs/source/_static/lflh_scenes/`.

**This trade-off is the honest headline of the addendum.** The prior that makes a scene plausible is
the same prior that makes the inverse problem hard, and at the budgets tried the model can have one
or the other. That is a sharper statement of the guidance's warning that priors must prevent absurd
scenes without defining the answer — here they are currently doing neither cleanly.

## 5. Status

**Works:** pair-conditioned, dual-objective, operator-conditioned LfLH amortises across 12 clips
and beats its input-ablation for crouch (0.986 vs 0.877) and left tuck (0.700 vs 0.653). Generated
scenes reach a 1.00 match rate under loose geometry.

**Does not work yet:** physically plausible geometry at the same match rate; `tuck_right`
amortisation; mixed-operator training.

**Next, in order.** (1) Anneal the *size prior* rather than the decoder — start loose so the model
finds the band, tighten to physical ranges as it converges; this is the direct fix for §4.
(2) Diagnose `tuck_right` against `tuck_left`, since they are mirror images and the asymmetry
points at a sign convention in the lateral gate. (3) Only then attempt mixed-operator training.


---

# Addendum 3, 2026-08-27: annealing the size prior resolves the trade-off

Addendum 2 ended on a trade-off: loose size ranges gave a 1.00 match rate and implausible 1.6 m
cubes, while physical ranges gave plank-like boxes and no convergence. Both halves are now
obtainable at once.

## What did not work: annealing the ranges

The obvious reading of "anneal the prior" is to start with wide extent ranges and narrow them.
That fails, and the reason is worth recording: the latent-to-metres map is a sigmoid **onto the
range**, so moving the range remaps every learned latent mid-training and the solution is lost.
Measured, the binding face collapsed to 0.06 x 0.08 x 0.04 m and reconstruction rose 3.233 → 3.654.

## What works: annealing a size *penalty*

Keep the parameterisation stationary on a permissive superset, and add a penalty that pulls the
extents toward a plausible shape — thin along route and vertically, wide across it — ramped in
after the first third of training, once the mechanism already has a working solution to deform.

| configuration | reconstruction | **match rate** | **plausible shape** | binding face |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| permissive space, no shape penalty, 900 steps | 3.730 | 0.021 | 0.36 | 0.21 x 0.50 x 0.93 m |
| **annealed size penalty, 900 steps** | 0.800 | **0.667** | **0.60** | 0.07 x 2.39 x 0.27 m |
| **annealed size penalty, 1800 steps** | **0.312** | **0.990** | **1.00** | **0.16 x 2.38 x 0.23 m** |

**Both objectives are satisfied together: a 0.990 selection rate with 100% of sampled binding faces
inside the plausible-shape ranges**, and the face is a plank — 0.16 m along route, 2.38 m across,
0.23 m thick. The penalty is not merely compatible with the mechanism, it *helps* it: at equal
steps the annealed run beats the unpenalised one on match rate by 30x, because shaping the search
is easier than searching a permissive space unaided.

This is the guidance's "priors should prevent absurd scenes, not define the answer", made
operational: as a soft term that arrives late, not as a boundary imposed from the start.

## Rendered scenes

`docs/source/_static/lflh_scenes/` — 24 videos, 12 clips x 2 draws, every obstacle sampled from
the trained hallucinator, placed into the world through each station's executed heading. Match rate
**1.00**: in every scene the differentiable decoder selects `crouch_040`, the motion the scene was
generated to explain. `docs/source/_static/lflh_scenes_relaxed/` keeps the unpenalised version for
comparison.

## Known remaining issue

Every sampled obstacle sits at height 1.75 m, which is exactly the ceiling of the height
parameterisation (`1.30 + tanh(z) * 0.45`). The height latent is saturating, so the model is
pressed against a boundary rather than choosing freely inside it. That should be widened, or the
height re-parameterised relative to the body's own reach at that station, before any claim is made
about *where* the model puts obstacles as opposed to *whether* they work.

## Status

| mechanism (decoder decides, sidedness) | verified by test |
